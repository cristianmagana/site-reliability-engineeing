# GEMINI - Interactive Agent Context & Private Notes

**Purpose:**
This file serves as a private context and scratchpad for the Gemini agent within the `site-reliability-engineering` repository. It is explicitly ignored by git to prevent it from being pushed to the public repository.

**Repository Goal:**
This repository acts as a private syllabus and knowledge base for Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), DevOps, and Platform Engineering. While the public README presents it as an informational resource, the depth and structure should support a graduate-level understanding and discourse, akin to a university curriculum.

**Guiding Principles for Content:**
1.  **Theory over Implementation:** Focus on the *why* and *what*, structural trade-offs, system design implications, and architectural patterns. Avoid specific tool implementations unless they serve to illustrate a broader concept.
2.  **Academic Rigor:** Content should reflect the depth of a graduate-level computer science lecture. Emphasize first principles, distributed systems theory, algorithmic complexity in operations, and the formalisms of reliability.
3.  **Domains:**
    *   Behavioral (Operational Thinking, Situational handling)
    *   Databases
    *   Kubernetes
    *   Linux
    *   Release Management
    *   Terminology

**Current Focus:**
*   **Release Management:** A theoretical examination of release engineering, exploring the economics of delivery, the quantification of risk, progressive delivery algorithms, and the intersection of release velocity and system stability.
