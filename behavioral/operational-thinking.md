# Operational Thinking for Teams

## Customer First

How we impact our customers and improve their day-to-day is how we approach every problem. Always look at the situation from their perspective.

## Two Way Door vs. One Way Door

In the simplest terms, a "two-way door decision" is easy to reverse, and a "one-way door decision" is impossible or very costly to reverse. For the scope of this engagement only, a one-way door will be something that would require every engineering team to make a manual change or would require more than a quarter for the platform to change.

## Fast Thinking

This mode of thinking, when used to make decisions, is a fast solution based on built knowledge from similar problems and situations. This has the benefits of moving fast but the limitations of solving the problem only by leveraging the solutions we have used previously. This can be a great velocity enabler for two-way door decisions.

## Slow Thinking

The slow-thinking mode of problem-solving and decision-making has us slow down and look past our collective knowledge. It requires time, patience, and openness of mind which we could be lacking in the moment when solving problems leveraging fast thinking. We need this for one-way door decisions by default and may need it for some two-way door decisions in some capacity as we chart into unknown areas.

## Disagree and Commit

We will not all be aligned on how we solve the problems that our engineers face, how product management has prioritized them, and even if the problem is a problem worth solving. That is okay, that diversity is crucial to creative problem solving, but when it is time to make a choice and execute on it we need to disagree and then move forward and execute towards our common outcomes.

## Modularize our work

We need to break every deliverable into as many bite-sized pieces as possible and look to deliver that work as soon as possible. This is not to align with TPMO guidance on breaking down work Atlassian Cloud but to build a fast feedback loop with rapid delivery, validation, and course correction.

## Outcomes over Outputs

We are focused on delivering impact to our customers not completing tasks, checking boxes, or implementing cool technology X. Product Management, using brutal prioritization, will tell us what impacts the customer we are driving and from there we will move into ideation and execution.

## Andon Cord

The Andon Cord is a mechanism taken from Japanese manufacturing that enables workers to notify others of a quality or process problem. This means if anything is not working, including meetings, technical implementation details, or processes everyone on the team is empowered to stop, bring attention to the issue, and swarm on that till it is resolved.

## ELMO - Enough Let's Move On

People should be enabled to call out ELMO in a meeting when we have ratholed or over-rotated on a subject that we will not be able to solve in the time constraints of the meeting.
