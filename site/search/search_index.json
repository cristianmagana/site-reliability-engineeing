It should be tailored according to the specific job position. Show how your actions and your plans are in harmony. Your knowledge, enthusiasm, and efforts will go a long way in answering this question. A good way to answer this question is to illustrate how well this job aligns with your career goals.  In your answer, you should focus on your primary reasons: impact, learning, career growth.  Question variations:  - Why do you want to work here?  - How is this role in alignment with your career goals? - What do you want to get in your next job?  What drags you out of bed?  What is the interviewer looking for: The interviewer is looking for the motivational factors that keep you going. The interviewer will try to aggregate your answers, your strengths, and your background to form an overall view of you and assess how well you will fit in the team\u2019s needs.  Best practice to answer: Talk about what you care most deeply, why it matters to you, and how you have committed 100% of your energy to do things you care, no matter if it is technology advancement, business success, amazing user experience, or learning new things to expedite your growth.  It is ok to joke it is the kids and the alarm that get you up, but please do not stop there. The interviewers want to know more about what drives you.  Question variations:  - What keeps you going?  - If you have achieved financial freedom today, what will you be doing? - What is your dream job?  Do you have any questions for me?  What is the interviewer looking for: On one side, the interviewer is giving you an opportunity to ask questions so that you have a better understanding of the company. On the other hand, the interviewer is also going to form her opinion about how excited you are with the company, based on the questions you have asked.  Best practice to answer: You should think about two things here. One is to ask questions that you still have about the company and the role. Just as the company is interviewing you, you are interviewing it as well. The other is to ask questions that demonstrate your passion, knowledge and thought leadership in this space.  If you do not have questions or your questions are very superficial, it will be a clear indicator that you are not highly interested in the role, or you are not a curious person. Both cases are bad signs to an interviewer.  Below are some sample questions that can help you get started:  - What big trends do you see in xxx space in the next 3 years? - What 3-5 words will you use to describe the team\u2019s culture? - What are the biggest challenges that someone in this role will face? - What does your day look like? - How satisfied is the team with their career development? Conflict Resolution with a Colleague  What is the interviewer looking for: he interviewer is looking for the conflict resolution skills and your resilience. The following are a few areas that the interviewer is going to assess you.  - Did you listen well? - Did you try to fully understand the other party\u2019s story? - Did you work with other parties to come up with a creative solution to resolve the conflict, etc? - Did you try to resolve the conflict before escalation? Best practice to answer:  Use the STAR framework. Describe the situation and the task. The actions you took to resolve the situation and the result. Ideally, showcase some good moves that you undertook to resolve the conflict. Some sample moves are:  - Proactively reach out to the other party to fully understand their perspective.  - Assume good intent. Do not be judgmental about the other party\u2019s move. Most conflicts in a workplace is caused by misinterpreting the - other party\u2019s intent. - Steer both parties to find solutions that are optimized for the company and the combined team. - If needed, escalate to the right authorities in a timely manner.  - After the conflict was resolved, reach out to further strengthen the relationship with the other party.  Question variations:  - How did you resolve conflicts in your team?  - Tell me about a time when you had an issue with a coworker  - How do you handle disagreement with your teammates?  - Tell me about a situation when you had to work in a group that wasn\u2019t functioning well. What happened?  Disagree with Leadership  What is the interviewer looking for: The interviewer is looking for your involvement in the decision-making and post-decision process. In particular, how well did you function as a leader to make your voice heard before the decision? And how well did you demonstrate followership to support a decision that you disagree?  Best practice to answer: It is a good practice to share your philosophy about decisions. A good practice is to be actively involved in the decision discussion so that your voice is heard and assist the decision maker to make the right decision with all the relevant data and different perspectives available before the decision making. Once a decision is made, follow and support the decision even if you do not agree. To illustrate active participation during decision process, you should share your perspective and why you prefer this route, how does it compare with the ultimate decision. You should also share how the final decision played out. If it played out well, please share what you have learned from this. If it did not work out, did the team come back to retry with your approach? If it did, what could you have done differently to better influence the team before the decision was made?  Question variations:  - What do you do if you disagree with your manager? - Share one experience that you argued forcefully but turned out you were wrong. Experience of Compromising  What is the interviewer looking for: We have all experienced situations where people share different opinions and are stuck in stalemate since nobody can convince anyone. In such situations, it is often the case that proceeding with any option is better than being stuck. Strong leaders seek to make compromises in such cases so that the team can proceed. It is a critical skill to make the right compromises in any type of organizations. When asking this question, the interviewers are trying to assess your flexibility and your creativity to make the right compromises to resolve conflicts.  Best practice to answer:  Without saying, you need to use the STAR method to describe the situation, what you did and the result. Simply making a compromise is never a strong leadership. You need to showcase why making a compromise was the right thing to do in this circumstance, what you did to break the stalemate and how you subsequently resolved the conflict. Make sure you lay the foundation, why different people have different views and how everyone believes theirs is correct. Explain what you did to make sure everyone understood the situation, the compromises that the team had to make and articulate the actions that made a difference.  Question variations:  - Share one experience where you stepped back and found a better solution.  - Share an experience that solved a problem by collaborating with others.  Leadership  What is the interviewer looking for: Obviously, the expectation of leadership varies drastically based on your experience level. For a junior member, the interviewers will likely look for :  - Demonstrate and drive accountability, - Take initiatives, and - Foster collaboration among team members.    For a more senior candidate, the interviewers will likely look for:  - Establish vision, - Get buy-in across the organization, - Orchestrate the execution of a large-scale initiative, and - Drive changes  Best practice to answer:  It is impossible for you to cover every dimension of leadership. Please select a story that can primarily highlight one aspect of leadership that you want the interviewer to take away. Your primary goal is for the interviewer to remember the initiatives you had undertaken, the magnitude of the accomplishment, and the most significant leadership dimension you had demonstrated. To make sure your message genuinely stands out, you can provide a brief at the end of the story.  You may want to tell different stories depending who is asking the question since a hiring manager or a teammate may appreciate different things. It is perfectly fine for you to use the same story, but may want to emphasize different elements based on what you know about the interviewer.  Please make sure to be specific about the details of the project and what you did for it to be successful. There are many factors that contribute to the success of an initiative. You want to make the interviewer believe your leadership has played a critical role in the success.  Question variations:  - Tell me a successful project that you were part of  - Tell me an experience that you have driven a change successfully  Leadership Style  What is the interviewer looking for: We all want to work with strong individuals, and most of us do not want to work with jerks no matter how strong this individual is. When an interviewer asks for this question, she is trying to understand:  - What is your leadership style? - Will you be a good fit for the company? - Are you easy to work with? - Does she want you to be her teammate?   Best practice to answer:  Be genuine. Share the true leadership traits that you have heard others describe you. Do not try to be someone you are not. Use some light-weight examples to support your statement, but do not go into too much detail. The interviewer is asking for others perception about you. Too many details imply, you are trying too hard. For example, if you say you bring positive energy and fun to the team, you can give examples on how many team events you organize, either ad-hoc or planned, but no need to go into specific detail for the events since they are not important for the question. Again, 3 is the magic number. Please pick up three things to describe your own leadership style. At the end, do a brief summary so that the interviewer has the best chance to capture and appreciate it.  Question variations:  - What\u2019s your leadership style?  - Which leadership trait do you wish to have but you do not possess today?  <ol> <li> <p>Give me an example of a time you had a conflict with a team member.

<code>cs</code>: - Context switches typically exceed interrupts (78 &gt; 42 in this example) - One interrupt can trigger multiple context switches - Context switches also occur due to scheduling, I/O waits, and time slicing - Ratio here: ~1.86 context switches per interrupt</p> <p>CPU and Core Detection: - vmstat shows combined CPU statistics across all cores - Cannot directly determine CPU/core count from vmstat output - Use these commands for CPU/core information:   <code>bash   nproc                    # Total processing units   lscpu                    # Detailed CPU architecture   cat
